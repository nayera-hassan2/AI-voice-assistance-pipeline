Detailed Description of Solution

Overview:

The end-to-end AI voice assistance pipeline involves converting a voice command into text, processing that text through a Large Language Model (LLM), and converting the response back into speech. The system is designed to have low latency, detect voice activity, restrict the output to two sentences, and allow for tunable parameters such as pitch, voice type (male/female), and speed.

Step-by-Step Implementation:

Step 1: Voice-to-Text Conversion

Model Choice: We use the Whisper model from OpenAI for converting speech to text. Whisper is known for its high accuracy and support for multiple languages.
Settings:
Sampling Rate: 16 kHz
Audio Channel Count: 1 (Mono)
VAD Threshold: 0.5 (to detect voice activity and ignore silence)
Step 2: Text Input into LLM

Model Choice: We use the transformers library from Hugging Face to access a pre-trained LLM like Mistral or similar for text generation.
Settings:
Model: Mistral
Response Length: Restricted to 50 tokens (approximately 2 sentences)
Step 3: Text-to-Speech Conversion

Model Choice: We use edge-tts, an open-source Text-to-Speech model that supports adjustable parameters such as pitch, voice type, and speed.
Settings:
Voice: en-US-JennyNeural
Pitch: +10%
Speed: +5%
Additional Requirements

Latency: The system is designed to achieve low latency by leveraging efficient models and pipelines.
Voice Activity Detection (VAD): Implemented with a threshold to ensure only voice is processed.
Output Restriction: Response text is truncated to a maximum of two sentences.
Tunable Parameters: Allow for adjustments in pitch, voice type, and speed in the text-to-speech conversion.

2. Code Snippets

Here’s the Python code implementing each step of the pipeline:

import whisper
from transformers import pipeline
import edge_tts
import asyncio

# Step 1: Speech-to-Text Conversion
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    model = whisper.load_model("base")
    result = model.transcribe(audio_file, language='en', vad_threshold=0.5)
    return result['text']

# Step 2: Text Input into LLM
def generate_response(input_text):
    llm = pipeline("text-generation", model="Mistral")
    response = llm(input_text, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)
    return response[0]['generated_text']

# Step 3: Text-to-Speech Conversion
async def text_to_speech(text, output_file="output.mp3"):
    communicate = edge_tts.Communicate(text, voice="en-US-JennyNeural", pitch="+10%", rate="+5%")
    await communicate.save(output_file)

# Example usage
audio_file = "path_to_audio_file.wav"
text_output = speech_to_text(audio_file)
response_text = generate_response(text_output)
output_file = "response_audio.mp3"
asyncio.run(text_to_speech(response_text, output_file))

print("Pipeline Completed! Audio response saved to:", output_file)

Architecture Diagram

You can create an architecture diagram to visualize the pipeline. Here’s a basic layout:

Voice Input:

Source: Microphone or Audio File
Converts to: Audio Signal
Speech-to-Text (Whisper):

Converts: Audio Signal to Text
Text Generation (LLM):

Converts: Text Query to Response Text
Text-to-Speech (edge-tts):

Converts: Response Text to Audio File
Output:

Result: Audio File (e.g., response_audio.mp3)
